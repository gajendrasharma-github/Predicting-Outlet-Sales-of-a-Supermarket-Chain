# Predicting Outlet Sales of a Grocery Mart Chain

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the sales of various outlets in a grocery mart chain using historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to forecast sales at the outlet level, enabling better inventory management, strategic planning, and overall revenue optimization.

## Problem Statement

Grocery mart chains often face challenges in predicting outlet-level sales due to the diverse factors influencing customer behavior and purchasing patterns. Accurately forecasting these sales is critical for optimizing stock levels, minimizing waste, and maximizing profitability. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales for different outlets in the chain, taking into account factors such as store location, size, and product visibility.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Item Identifier:** Unique ID for each product.
- **Item Weight:** Weight of the product.
- **Item Fat Content:** Category indicating the fat content of the product (e.g., Low Fat, Regular).
- **Item Visibility:** The percentage of total display area allocated to the product in the store.
- **Item Type:** Category of the product (e.g., Dairy, Meat, Fruits).
- **Item MRP:** Maximum Retail Price of the product.
- **Outlet Identifier:** Unique ID for each outlet in the chain.
- **Outlet Establishment Year:** The year in which the outlet was established.
- **Outlet Size:** The size of the outlet (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- **Outlet Location Type:** The type of city in which the outlet is located (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
- **Outlet Type:** Type of the outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket).
- **Sales:** The target variable representing the sales of the product at the given outlet.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning models.
  
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict sales for a grocery mart chain. By accurately forecasting sales at the outlet level, the model provides valuable insights that can help in making data-driven decisions, improving inventory management, and optimizing overall operations.
